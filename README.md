# SignLanguageLettersDeepLearningProject

Link to the files I've used in the model : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tDMFhrHAOQUDHNkjgZO85gaHOQmGfu-A?usp=sharing

I recorded videos of my hand making sign language letters.

Then Converted those videos into Images as shown in the Google drive folder by using VideoToImages Code.

Then Used those images as Input Data for my simple Deep Learning Model.

The Code Pretty much explains itself.
